# Single-Phase Transformer Analysis: Open-Circuit, Short-Circuit, and Rated-Load Testing with Theoretical and Simulation Validation

This repository analyzes a single-phase transformer through theoretical modeling, simulation, and experimental testing under open-circuit, short-circuit, and rated-load conditions.

## Analysis Overview:
The study includes:
- **Theoretical Analysis** of the transformer’s operation based on electromagnetic induction and equivalent circuit modeling.
- **Open-Circuit Test, Short-Circuit Test, Rated-Load Test**:
  - **Magnetic Induction Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of magnetic induction at various points in the transformer.
  - **Losses Calculation**: Calculating losses in the defined problem area
  - **Magnetic Induction Along the Core**: Examining the magnetic induction distribution along a straight section inside the transformer’s core 
- **Simulation Validation**: Comparing theoretical results with simulated data using FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics).

## Tools Used:
- **FEMM** for simulations

## Results:
The analysis provides insights into the transformer’s **losses**, **efficiency**, and **behavior under load**. The results from both simulations and theoretical calculations were compared and validated to ensure accuracy.
